    #See if any family size features might help --
    #do the number of women in a family make the whole family more likely to survive?

    #Does the national origin of the passenger's name have anything to do with survival?

    #Try the random forest classifier in the ensemble.

    #A support vector machine might work well with this data.

    #We could try neural networks.

    #Boosting with a different base classifier might work better.

    #Could majority voting be a better ensembling method than averaging probabilities?
